# Release System Summary

Your Andy CLI project now has a complete automated release system set up!

## What's Been Created

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflows

**`.github/workflows/release.yml`** - Standard unsigned releases
- Builds for 5 platforms (macOS ARM64/x64, Linux x64/ARM64, Windows x64)
- Runs tests before building
- Creates trimmed, single-file binaries (~29MB each)
- Generates checksums
- Creates GitHub Release with all artifacts
- **Triggered manually** - you control when to release

**`.github/workflows/release-signed.yml`** - Code-signed releases (optional)
- Same as above, plus code signing support
- Signing steps are commented out
- Ready to enable when you have certificates

### 2. Documentation

**`RELEASE.md`** - Complete release process documentation
- How to create releases
- Setting up code signing (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- Versioning guidelines
- Testing procedures
- Troubleshooting guide

**`.github/RELEASE_QUICKSTART.md`** - Quick reference guide
- Simple step-by-step instructions
- 5 minute guide to creating releases
- Common troubleshooting

**`.github/RELEASE_TEMPLATE.md`** - Release notes template
- Structure for release notes
- Sections for features, fixes, breaking changes

### 3. Local Build Script

**`scripts/build-release.sh`** - Build all platforms locally
- Test releases before publishing
- Creates same artifacts as CI
- Useful for testing

## How to Create Your First Release

### Option 1: Quick Start (Recommended)

1. **Push your code to GitHub** (if not already there)

2. **Go to GitHub Actions**
   ```
   Your Repo â†’ Actions Tab â†’ Release â†’ Run workflow
   ```

3. **Enter details**
   - Version: `v0.1.0` (or whatever you want)
   - Pre-release: âœ“ (for first release, to test)

4. **Wait ~10 minutes** for builds to complete

5. **Check the Release**
   - Go to Releases tab
   - See your new release with 5 platform binaries
   - Edit to add release notes

### Option 2: Test Locally First

```bash
# Build all platforms locally
./scripts/build-release.sh v0.1.0-test

# Check the artifacts
ls -lh release-artifacts/

# When ready, use GitHub Actions for the real release
```

## What Gets Published

Each release includes:

### Binaries
- `andy-cli-macos-arm64.tar.gz` - macOS Apple Silicon
- `andy-cli-macos-x64.tar.gz` - macOS Intel
- `andy-cli-linux-x64.tar.gz` - Linux 64-bit
- `andy-cli-linux-arm64.tar.gz` - Linux ARM
- `andy-cli-windows-x64.zip` - Windows 64-bit

### Checksums
- SHA256 checksums for all binaries
- Users can verify downloads

### Release Notes
- Automatically generated installation instructions
- You add: features, fixes, changes

## Key Features

âœ… **Manual Control** - Release when YOU want, not on every merge
âœ… **Multi-Platform** - 5 platforms in one click
âœ… **Tested** - Tests run before building
âœ… **Small Binaries** - Trimmed to ~29MB (was 98MB)
âœ… **Checksums** - SHA256 for security
âœ… **Ready for Signing** - Code signing prepared (optional)
âœ… **GitHub Releases** - Professional release page
âœ… **Downloadable** - Direct download links for users

## Optional: Code Signing

Code signing is **optional** but recommended for production releases. It:
- Verifies binaries come from you
- Prevents "Unknown developer" warnings
- Builds user trust

To enable:
1. Get certificates (Apple, Authenticode, GPG)
2. Add secrets to GitHub
3. Uncomment signing steps in `release-signed.yml`
4. Use that workflow instead

See `RELEASE.md` for detailed setup instructions.

## Cost

- GitHub Actions: **FREE** for public repositories
- Code signing certificates: **$99-400/year** (optional)

## Next Steps

1. **Test the release workflow**
   ```bash
   # Go to Actions â†’ Release â†’ Run workflow
   # Create v0.1.0-test as pre-release
   ```

2. **Download and test the binaries**
   ```bash
   # Download each platform's binary
   # Test on actual machines
   ```

3. **Create your first real release**
   ```bash
   # When satisfied: v1.0.0
   # Uncheck pre-release
   ```

4. **Set up code signing** (optional)
   - Follow RELEASE.md instructions
   - Test with release-signed.yml

## Support

- **Quick questions**: See `.github/RELEASE_QUICKSTART.md`
- **Detailed docs**: See `RELEASE.md`
- **Build locally**: Use `scripts/build-release.sh`

## Summary

You now have a **professional, automated release system** that:
- Builds 5 platforms automatically
- Runs tests before releasing
- Creates professional GitHub releases
- Is triggered manually (you control timing)
- Supports code signing (when ready)
- Generates checksums for security
- Provides great user experience

**Ready to release!** ðŸš€
